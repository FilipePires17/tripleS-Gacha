# triples_gacha

tripleS Gacha is clone of the collection system from 'Cosmo: The Origin', an app owned by Modhaus.

## Getting Started

This app let you collect fake Objekts(NFTs of the idols from tripleS) for free, since a lot of people can't buy all the Objekts. It does not intend to replace the original app, the idea here is to test your luck trying to get the Objekts you want, since there are a lot of Objekts that task can be really hard to accomplish.

## How to actually play it

You'll need to download some tools to be able to build the APK, you can clone this repository using git in the Windows Powershell, using the command:
```bash
git clone something
```
You can also just download the zip file with all the code, but you will have to unzip it. After that download and install flutter on your PC, you might need to restart it. On Powershell head to the project folder and run:
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter build apk
```
If everything goes as planned you'll be able to find the apk in triples_gacha/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
