# triples_gacha

tripleS Gacha is clone of the collection system from 'Cosmo: The Origin', an app owned by Modhaus.

## Getting Started

This app let you collect fake Objekts(NFTs of the idols from tripleS) for free, since a lot of people can't buy all the Objekts. It does not intend to replace the original app, the idea here is to test your luck trying to get the Objekts you want, since there are a lot of Objekts that task can be really hard to accomplish.

## How to actually play it

It only works in Android devices.
You'll need to download the APK through this [tripleS Gacha drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a3ZTEL_3A8IkHnUTjyVx-FdlA_KBr3Lg?usp=share_link). The [tripleS-Gacha.apk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16m9czGvVoNr_R31SPSceS3lVsp7BipJH/view?usp=share_link) is the default file to download, if you want to download a lighter version you can choose one of the other 3 options in the folder, but you have to know what ABI your Android device works on, most devices will work with the tripleS-Gacha-arm64-v8a.apk version, but if you're not sure please download the default version. When you try to install it your phone may give you a warning about not installing external apks, but install it anyway, it will not harm your device.
